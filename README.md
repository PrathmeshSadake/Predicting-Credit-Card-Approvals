# Predicting Credit Card Approvals
**Machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.**

**Project Description**

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning, and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. The aim of this project is to develop an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do. The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


## Project Tasks

- Inspecting the applications
- Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
- Handling the missing values
- Preprocessing the data
- Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
- Making predictions and evaluating performance
- Grid searching and making the model perform better
- Finding the best performing model
